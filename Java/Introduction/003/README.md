Java Introduction: Stdin and Stdout 2
=================

Problem 3:
-----------
  
Input Format:  
There will be three lines of input. The first line will have an integer. The second line will have a double number. The last line will consist of a string.  


Output Format:  
Print the string in the first line, the double in the second line and the integer in the third line. See the sample output for exact formatting. 
  
To make the problem easier, some part of the code is already provided in the editor. Note that Scanner's nextInt() method doesn't read the last newline character of the input, you need to keep this in mind if you use nextLine() after using nextInt().
